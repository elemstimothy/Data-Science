# Movie Recommender System

Movies are great for chillaxing... til they end. Then you gotta go out seeking your next fix. This ends now! 
This is a system that learns your watching pattern and in turn provides you with relevant suggestions.

In this project, we will use ratings collected from real users along with movie details and user demographics to recommend top movies, thus enhancing the user experience for an online streaming service.
